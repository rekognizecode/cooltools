# cooltools

This is a repository where I want to collect and share all the cool tools one might feel helpful and or I use every day.
I mostly want to focus on free and open source software, but exceptions might also occur, if the tools are neat enough.

I will add the ability for everyone to add their favorite tools, but am still figuring out the best way how to do that.

STOP gate keeping the best tools, share to make everyone work more efficient, time and mnoney wise.
